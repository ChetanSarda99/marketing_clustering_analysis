A very warm thanks to Daisy Ya for guiding us through marketing analysis and giving us the opportunity to work on this project.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to use K-means clustering to segment wholesale customers. To identify distinct customer groups, we analyze a dataset containing various product spending data. To gain insights into customer behavior, the project employs data exploration, feature scaling, and clustering algorithms.

Key Project Steps:-

1. Data Exploration
After loading the dataset, review its structure and feature distribution to find any anomalies, such as outliers or missing values.
Used boxen plots and histograms to visualize the distribution of the data.

2. Feature Scaling
Normalized the data with a right-skewed distribution by using StandardScaler.

3. K-means Clustering
Applied the elbow method to ascertain the ideal number of clusters.
Then used K-means clustering.

4. Analysis and Interpretation
Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster in a business context.
Visualized clusters for better understanding and interpretation from a business perspective.
