A very warm thanks to Daisy Ya for guiding us through marketing analysis and giving us the opportunity to work on this project.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use K-means clustering to segment wholesale customers. To identify distinct customer groups, we analyze a dataset containing various product spending data. To gain insights into customer behavior, the project employs data exploration, feature scaling, and clustering algorithms.

Key Project Steps:

Data Exploration
After loading the dataset, review its structure and feature distribution to find any anomalies, such as outliers or missing values.
Use boxen plots and histograms to visualize the distribution of the data.

Feature Scaling
Normalize data with a right-skewed distribution by using StandardScaler.

K-means Clustering
Applying the elbow method, ascertain the ideal number of clusters.
To segment your customer base, use K-means clustering.

Analysis and Interpretation
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster in a business context.
Visualize clusters for better understanding and interpretation.
